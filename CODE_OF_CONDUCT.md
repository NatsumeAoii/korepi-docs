## Our Principles

We are committed to creating a positive environment for all. Our interactions are guided by the following principles:

**1. Be Respectful and Inclusive**
> We are a global community with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Respect is the cornerstone of our interactions.

-   **Celebrate Differences:** Welcome and respect people regardless of age, background, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, or sexual orientation.
-   **Listen with Empathy:** Seek to understand others' viewpoints, even when you disagree. Constructive dialogue thrives on mutual respect.
-   **Use Welcoming Language:** Avoid exclusionary language, stereotypes, and slang that may be offensive or difficult for a global audience to understand.

**2. Assume Good Intent**
> We believe that our community members are here to contribute positively. Approach disagreements with the assumption that everyone is acting in good faith.

-   **Clarify Before Accusing:** If a comment seems ambiguous or offensive, ask for clarification respectfully before jumping to conclusions.
-   **Give Graceful Feedback:** When offering criticism, focus on the content, not the person. Frame your feedback constructively and with the goal of improvement.

**3. Be Collaborative and Supportive**
> Our collective strength comes from helping each other grow. We build each other up.

-   **Share Knowledge Generously:** Help others by answering questions, providing examples, and sharing what you've learned.
-   **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** Recognize and thank fellow community members for their contributions, no matter how small.
-   **Support Newcomers:** Be patient and helpful to those who are new to our community or to development in general.

**4. Maintain a Harassment-Free Environment**
> We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment in any form. Our community must be a safe space for everyone.

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
-   **Personal Attacks:** Insults, threats, trolling, or derogatory comments directed at an individual.
-   **Unwelcome Advances:** Sexualized language, imagery, or any form of unwanted sexual attention.
-   **Discrimination:** Any conduct that discriminates against individuals or groups.
-   **Doxing:** Publishing private information (e.g., name, address, email) of others without their explicit consent.
-   **Disruptive Behavior:** Sustained disruption of discussions, such as "trolling" or derailing conversations.
